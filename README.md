# spatial-studies


# Overview

The human experience is 4-dimensional, but we only control our movement in 3. This study group focuses on formal and informal approaches to 3D lived space—construction and deconstruction, interpretation, representation, meaning, experience, and power. 

Space, as an object (not “outer space”), is studied from the vantage point of many fields; here, we seek to discuss it in a transdisciplinary environment that brings together tools from all of these different groups. How does the set designer approach space, versus the architect, the dancer, the urban planner, the physicist, the geographer? 

What is space? How do we talk about it? How do we describe or parameterize it? What power does space exert, and who controls space? How is space different from place? How do humans experience space, psychologically and phenomenologically? These are questions we seek to explore.
